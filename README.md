Learning-Java
=============

Now that I have a more solid grasp of computer science concepts, I thought it was time to delve back into learning Java. I'm expecting it to go quite smoothly since I'm so much more experienced now. :]

* Primarily small projects from the book 'Head First Java' (recommended textbook for my CS 61B course at UC Berkeley)
* Also old archived exercises from the University of Helsinki online CS course (http://mooc.cs.helsinki.fi/programming-part1)
