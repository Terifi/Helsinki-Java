Learning-Java
=============

A repository for small projects and practice exercises as I work my way through Java. Most of my studying revolves arouns the University of Helsinki materials here: (http://mooc.cs.helsinki.fi/programming-part1). My goal is to have a solid grasp of the Java syntax before I finish my CS 61A course at UC Berkeley so that I can jump into CS 61B and hit the ground running.
